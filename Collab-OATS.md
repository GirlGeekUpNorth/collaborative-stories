Once upon a time, there was a boy called Oliver. The end 
...or was it? Little did he know what was on the horizon.
There was a green Slobbery Monster. He whispered in my ear Shrek is love Shrek is life.
I knew at this time, he was part of the cult and soon Oliver would be next. I had to do everything to stop the green horror from taking over the universe. But how?
I prayed for the wrath of the Teletubbies to rain down on Shrek but there was no reply.

This is a story about two confused programmers.
They're not just confused, they're absolutely mind boggled!
But slowly things might be starting to make sense.....maybe.
They're trying to understand conflicts.
They're beginning to see the bigger picture.
Creating and merging branches has been practised and understood.
Now they're partying because they finally get it!
So now they're practising reviewing.
But they're stuck again! What a mess!
They're probably going to get some more practice at conflicts soon...but they're ready for it!
They fixed the conflict - woohoo!
Are they sure?
